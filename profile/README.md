Item 1: Business Plan

Company name: HomeHub Tech


Long-Term Vision-Statement:


Goals: The primary goal of our company is to create a series of new smart home products that can seamlessly connect to devices from other ecosystems. Our hub would allow users to interact with devices whether they are Apple HomeKit, Google Home, or Amazon Alexa-based. Our line of smart devices would also be compatible with these ecosystems and will be built on the Matter specification. 


Where is the Idea From? The idea comes from David’s personal experience with smart home devices. He had initially purchased several devices that worked in Google Home’s Nest series. After switching to the Apple ecosystem, he found that his Google devices did not interface with Apple HomeKit. The HomeHub was born from the frustrations of using a separate app to control each part of his home.


What is the purpose, values, and mission? How can we securely and seamlessly solve the problem of smart home devices not all working together? What is needed to not only bring a smart home together but to make it convenient for the user? The HomeHub aims to be one of the forerunners of bringing Matter to the general public while also providing our first-party offerings that will streamline your smart home. Above all else, we value our customers' privacy and will strive to keep their homes secure while still providing the convenience of using all their devices in a single app. We do this for everybody tired of fumbling around on their phone at the end of a long workday to unlock their front door because they can’t give a voice command to Siri, Alexa, or Google.
